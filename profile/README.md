## Q&A

### What is Dogeverse?
Dogeverse is a Miiverse Revival project (based on aquamarine) aiming to capture the essence of Miiverse (UI Design, General Charm, etc), while giving it newer and modern features.

### How do I install Dogeverse?
Currently Dogeverse is in development, so no builds are avaliable to the general public yet. Periodically, we may have open betas, that allow people to come in and test certain functions.

### How can I follow Dogeverse's development?
Go fuck yourself ðŸ˜Š /j

### How come the game/app *insert name here* doesn't work as intended!
Some applications use something called app data. App Data is a string coded into most communities that allow games to communicate with them. Most of these strings have not been found by data-miners or reverse engineerers. If/when those strings are found, we'll be sure to implement them into our API. Another factor that could affect games is patches, as some games had Miiverse completely patched out of them in an update.

### What about Pretendo?
Pretendo is a seperate revival service that revives Miiverse, as well as most other online services for the Wii U and 3DS. Dogeverse only revives Miiverse.
